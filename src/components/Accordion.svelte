            <p>
                I work from first principles to understand the problems and
                desired outcomes from a high level.<br /><br />From there, I
                conduct research to map out existing solutions and derive a path
                forward.<br /><br />I pull from a wide range of mental
                frameworks and digital tools to progress through the stages of
                design, arriving at a solution that is aesthetically pleasing,
                highly functional, and technically realistic.
